File Storage
Given a file size, a unit for the file size, and hard drive capacity in gigabytes (GB), return the number of files the hard drive can store using the following constraints:

The unit for the file size can be bytes ("B"), kilobytes ("KB"), or megabytes ("MB").
Return the number of whole files the drive can fit.
Use the following conversions:
Unit	Equivalent
1 B	1 B
1 KB	1000 B
1 MB	1000 KB
1 GB	1000 MB
For example, given 500, "KB", and 1 as arguments, determine how many 500 KB files can fit on a 1 GB hard drive.



Tests
Passed:1. number_of_files(500, "KB", 1) should return 2000.
Passed:2. number_of_files(50000, "B", 1) should return 20000.
Passed:3. number_of_files(5, "MB", 1) should return 200.
Passed:4. number_of_files(4096, "B", 1.5) should return 366210.
Passed:5. number_of_files(220.5, "KB", 100) should return 453514.
Passed:6. number_of_files(4.5, "MB", 750) should return 166666.
